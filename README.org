* What is this?

This is a set of [[https://www.archimatetool.com/][Archi]] scripts in order to generate simple =humane images= from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate][Archimate]] diagrams (plain rectangles and lines).
- Design like an Architect with Archimate conventions (or custom conventions)
- Share diagrams with human beings: =What does this icon mean???=

* Requirements

- Archi 4.9.x (this has only been tested with the latest version of
- The latest version of [[https://www.archimatetool.com/plugins/#jArchi][jArchi]] compatible with Archi 4.9.x
- The [[https://www.graalvm.org/][GraalVM]] JavaScript engine selected in Archi preferences (=Scripting > JavaScript Engine=)


* How to use it?

Please clone this repository under your jArchi scripts folder (=Preferences >Scriting > Scripts folder:=): if you still don't understand the procedure, please visit the [[https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-scripting-plugin/wiki/jArchi-Quick-Start][jArchi wiki]] or [[https://forum.archimatetool.com/index.php?board=5.0][forum]].

You can then right-click on any diagram in Archi and explore available scripts (=Scripts > humaneimage=).

* How does it work?


** Overall process

There's just a little bit of custom drawing happening with few hooks into Java instead of "pure JavaScript".

** Scripts description

The main library is under =lib/humaneimage.lib.js= and the scripts under the =humageimage= folder are just interfaces to it.

The best way to contribute is via a pull request.

* Notes

I did not write the whole functionality from scratch.
- =edraw2d.lib.jar= is a utility class with a *subset* of [[https://github.com/eclipse/gef-legacy/tree/master/org.eclipse.draw2d][Eclipse draw2d libraries]] (bare minimum classes required, repackaged without SWT dependencies)
- =svgtopng.lib.jar= is a utility class with bundled [[https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/][Apache Batik]] dependencies
